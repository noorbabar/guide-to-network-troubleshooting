# guide-to-network-troubleshooting

A guide to diagnose and resolve common network issues.

I work as a Microsoft Advisor, and customers often travel long distances just to ask for help with technical issues. I built this as both a learning tool for myself and a reference I can pull up when helping customers.

After INFS1701 (a course i took at unsw) gave me a beginner intro to networking, I wanted to deepen my understanding of networking and cybersecurity. This documents the technical problems I encounter, solutions I've found, and tools I'm learning like Kali Linux and Wireshark. It's as much for my own development as it is for helping others.

## What This Is

A comprehensive resource for diagnosing and fixing network problems that actually occur in real environments. Based on issues I encounter daily helping customers, this guide provides clear, actionable solutions without the technical jargon.

Built for anyone dealing with connectivity issues who needs practical guidance, not theory.

## What's Included

**Diagnostic Workflows** → Step by step processes for identifying network issues quickly

**Common Problems & Solutions** → Real scenarios from customer support cases with proven fixes

**Command Reference** → Essential networking commands for Windows, Linux, macOS

**Knowledge Base** → Documentation of networking fundamentals as I learn them (DNS, OSI model, TCP/IP, routing protocols, etc.)

**Tool Documentation** → Guides for Wireshark, Kali Linux, network analysis tools

**Troubleshooting Decision Trees** → Visual guides for systematic problem solving

## Why I Built This

Working in support, I see the same network issues repeatedly. I needed a reference I could quickly pull up to help customers, but I also wanted to deepen my understanding beyond the basics I learned in INFS1701.

By working with tools like Wireshark and Kali Linux, and documenting everything I encounter, I'm building both my cybersecurity knowledge and a practical resource customers can use without traveling for help.
